Currently, NFTs can only be sold on the decentralized NFT trading market, and the first centralized NFT exchange will also be launched by Binance in the near future. Here we introduce how to buy NFT in the decentralized NFT market.

**Create a wallet**

At present, mainstream NFT assets are mostly released and sold on Etherum / Binance Smart Chain. Therefore, we need to have a decentralized wallet for the storage of FT and NFT assets. At present, the mainstream wallets include MathWallet, Metamask, Trust Wallet, etc.

Note: Before purchasing NFT, you need to ensure that there are enough ETH/BNB assets in the wallet, and the corresponding assets can be purchased through a centralized exchange
