## Murakami Takashi

Murakami Takashi is a famous Japanese trend artist. On April 23, 2021, Takashi Murakami posted a long post on Instagram, expounding his views on NFT. Murakami had previously auctioned the pixel version of Sunflower NFT on the NFT trading platform OpenSea, but later cancelled the auction event because he wanted to learn more about NFT. He thinks that those cute or sci-fi NFT works will be the trend of this era, they are completely different from contemporary art, and his always creative style, super flat, is very suitable for this era. Therefore, he has a keen interest in NFT art, and by immersing himself in the trend of this era, he has realized the meaning of ultra-flat and the direction of the subsequent development of ultra-flat.
