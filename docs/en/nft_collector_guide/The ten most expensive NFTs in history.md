**《The Pixel》By: Pak**

**Final price:$1,355,555**

****

From April 12th to 14th, the works of a mysterious digital artist Pak were listed in the world's top auction house-Sotheby's.

****

The starting price of "The Pixel" was $1, and the final hammer price was $1.35 million.

Pak's artistic style has been controversial. Some people say that Pak is the future of art, but some people sneer at Pak's work.

Pak is a black and white "o" in the public's impression. Some people call Pak "The Nothing". Whether Pak is a man or a woman, an individual or a team, is still a mystery. It wasn't until Pak's work was put up for auction that Pak was willing to accept interviews with a voice changer.

The art world’s enthusiastic pursuit of anonymous art has also made collectors more enamored of Pak’s works. For example, the collector Eric Young who photographed The Pixel once stated that “Pak is not the kind of moderate role”.

Returning to the work, this seemingly monotonous pure gray work is visually presented by a single pixel, and the auction house describes it as "This is a symbol, marking the most basic unit of a traditional global auction house's digital image. Bring digital art into a tiny point in the potential future history."

"The Switch" is an interactive programming artwork. The description says, "It symbolizes the evolution of artwork in the digital realm. The owner of this NFT can use it and produce a certain irreversible effect."

However, what irreversible effects will be produced is still a mystery for the time being.
