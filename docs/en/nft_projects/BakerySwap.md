**What is your belief in NFT? Which field do you think has the most potential for NFT to be implemented? **

The type of assets that are tokenized in an NFT does not go by the standard rule of supply and demand. Assets like painting and artwork increase in value because of their scarcity. For other tradable goods, an increase in demand is met with an increase in supply. But, an increase in demand for Picasso’s artwork will never lead to an increase in supply. This scarcity helps the underlying assets of NFT to grow in value. NFT is going to grow in the future because it's far more inclusive and exciting than the traditional realm of DeFi investments. In the DeFi market, the interest is towards only the financial return. Here, in NFT, the user expects a far deeper reward at the psychological level. With the world becoming full of digital-native objects, NFT is also expected to permanently settle the question of ownership.
