Decentraland is a decentralized virtual reality platform based on the Ethereum. Its core asset is the limited and passable 3D virtual space LAND, which is an NFT asset maintained by the Ethereum smart contract. Decentraland will be officially open to everyone on February 20th. Players can directly log in to the game to create an Avatar and play in the Decentraland game world. Decentraland completed the public offering of the token MANA in August 2017, and completed the ETH fundraising worth 24 million US dollars in 35 seconds. MANA Token can be used to purchase territory, goods and services, and can also be used as an incentive measure to encourage content creation and user adoption, thereby realizing a decentralized virtual world.
