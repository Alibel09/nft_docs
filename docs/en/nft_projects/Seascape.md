**Could you introduce your project?**
Seascape Network is a blockchain gaming platform built around the NFT and DeFi economy. We aim to bring true usability to NFT in a multitude of ways and to incentives users by interacting with any aspect of the ecosystem. Our motto is Play to Earn, instead of the traditional Pay to Win.
​

**What is your belief in NFT? Which field do you think has the most potential for NFT to be implemented? **
We believe that NFT can become much more than simple collectibles and have true value and utility. We are making this a reality by bringing NFT into our games into a multitude of uses, from in-game assets such as characters, equipement, and quest objects, all the way to actual financial products.
​

**What do you think is the biggest challenge so far in the NFT application? **
The first big challenge is the lack of usability and education. For example, people fail to see why simply copy pasting the picture isn't as good as having the actual NFT, or don't know what to do with NFTs in general.
​

**What is the most exciting part of your project so fa and in the future?**
Not only can you use our Scapes NFTs in a multitude of ways in games, or exchange/trade them in our marketplace, but you could even support new projects & games to be on the Seascape platform via our launchpad to see the new NFT styles and use case that you want!
