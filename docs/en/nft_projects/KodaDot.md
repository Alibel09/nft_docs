KodaDot was the first NFT gallery on Kusama implemented RMRK standard and now we are looking forward for enter extended reality space to enter Metaverse space. We want to be an experimental interface to add various stuff and later be a common interface for https://metaprime.network.

Right now we are supporting artists and creators, later we think NFT will have broad impact in DID space, gaming assets and artificial content, with special emphasis on Metaverses.

**What do you think is the biggest challenge so far in the NFT application? **
Probably UX for users and how to onboard them easily, without having getting through fiat on-ramp. We established kodadotfaucet and giving small amount of KSM for newcomers.

With KodaDot community we are building experimental NFT landscape called Metaprime.network to pursue various NFT vectors out there
