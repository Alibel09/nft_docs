With the increasing value of NFT, we also need to pay attention to the security of NFT, which mainly includes the following aspects.

1\. Safe storage

If your NFT is a very expensive encryption art, it is recommended that you use a hardware wallet for storage. The more well-known ones include: Ledger, Trezor, etc.

2\. Safely backup wallet mnemonics

The use of decentralized wallets requires a certain basic understanding of the method of safely backing up mnemonic words, because whether it is a lost backup or a stolen backup, it will cause permanent loss of NFT assets. We recommend using market-proven blockchain wallets to store NFT assets, such as MathWallet, Trust, etc.

3\. Beware of fake NFTs

Ethereum is a permissionless infrastructure: anyone can cast any medium into NFT, especially on DIY platforms such as Rarible and OpenSea. This means that we must be wary of fake NFTs.

Some vetted NFT platforms like SuperRare and NiftyGateway do not have this problem.

But in the DIY market, you must double or even triple check all available information before buying. And it needs to go to the source of the information for verification, such as the Ethereum browser Etherscan.
