Burning an NFT effectively destroys the token and removes it entirely from the Ethereum blockchain. When you burn an NFT, the transaction is irreversible. 

The NFT destruction process will also produce different results according to the logic of the smart contract. 

**By category:**

Currently, there are two categories of NFTs, one is financial NFT, and the other is encrypted collection NFT. The financial NFT contains FT tokens. When the NFT is destroyed, the owner will obtain the FT tokens stored in the NFT. The ERC1155 standard NFT will obtain the token that was locked at the time of minting after it is destroyed, which is generally used in the scene of game props. This problem does not exist in the artwork category, and it is generally destroyed directly.

**By the destruction method:**

The first general destruction method is to send the NFT to an address where no one knows the private key, such as 0x0 

The second method of destruction requires the support of the protocol itself. For example, ERC1155 supports the destruction of NFTs and retrieves the tokens that were locked at the time of minting.
