Each NFT pass has a metadata URI, which is a json formatted text, which defines some more detailed information of the NFT, such as the name, description, URL of the picture, and its own special attributes.

We recommend that developers set the URI structure in accordance with the definition of the ETH standard, so that NFT trading platforms (such as Opensea) and decentralized wallets (such as MathWallet) can support and display the NFT.
