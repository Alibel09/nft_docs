In addition to storing the uniqueness on the chain in a smart contract, NFT generally associates pictures, music, videos and other files with Metadata for display. In order to achieve decentralized storage, they generally choose to use the IPFS protocol for storage.

For example, the NFT.Storage project allows developers to use content addressing and decentralized storage to protect NFT assets and related metadata-ensuring that all NFTs follow best practices and can be accessed for a long time.

With the flexibility and durability of IPFS and Filecoin, NFT.storage makes it extremely smooth to cast NFT in accordance with best practices.

**Working principle:**

1. Content addressing: After users upload data to NFT.Storage, they will get the IPFS hash of the content, also known as CID. CID is a unique fingerprint of data. No matter when and where content storage occurs, CID is a universal address that points to the content. Because CID is generated based on content, using it to point to NFT data can prevent possible problems caused by weak connections and rug-pull scams.
2. Provable storage: NFT.Storage realizes long-term distributed data storage through Filecoin-docking storage transactions and retrieval transactions to store NFT data for a long time. Filecoin uses cryptographic proof to provide a persistent protocol layer to ensure the durability and durability of NFT data.

1. Flexible retrieval: The data stored by IPFS and Filecoin can be easily obtained, just use a browser to open any public IPFS port.
