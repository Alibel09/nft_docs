If you decide to build a non-fungible token, you need to specify the market on which the NFT will be listed, as this will affect how and where the NFT is created.

Although there are more ways to create an NFT, it is important to choose a forum dedicated to NFT development. The easiest way is to build an NFT through a dedicated website. There are many. Rarible, Mintbase and Cargo are some of the frequently used ones. Some NFT markets (such as OpenSea, Treasurealand, etc.) also allow autonomous mint NFT.

When choosing a platform for building an NFT, you may need to consider one or more blockchains used by the platform. After all, a series of blockchains including Ethereum, Binance Smartchain, Dapper Labs' Flow, Tron, EOS, Polkadot, Tezos, Cosmos, and WAX all support NFT growth.

Different NFT platforms alleviate high mining and mining fees in unique ways, and each blockchain has its own irreplaceable token standard. This means that if you build an irreplaceable token on the Ethereum blockchain, you can only sell it on the Ethereum-based token market. (In other words, you will not be able to sell Ethereum-based NFTs on networks that only allow the sale of Binance Smart Chain NFTs.)

OpenSea has an excellent USP (Quick Transaction) feature, which allows you to stop mining fees during the listing process and activate it only when the goods are sold. Choosing OpenSea can avoid the initial expenditure.
