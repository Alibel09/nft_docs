Copyright is the protection of the expression of ideas. For example, encrypted cats refer to the image of cats.During the creation of CryptoKitties, Dapper Labs obtained the copyright of the CryptoKitties image, and this copyright has not been transferred with the NFT.

In the figure below, we can see that the rights of the NFT owner are mainly the right to control the token and the right to display this IP in the form of NFT.

The copyright owner still has the remaining rights, including: distribution, reproduction, public performance, display, and related derivatives.

Of course, as a new form of assets, NFT's rights will continue to expand with the development of new scenarios such as blockchain and meta-universe. The current definition of the rights it obtains is only a very early stage.
