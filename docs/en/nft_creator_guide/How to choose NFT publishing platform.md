When choosing an NFT publishing platform, what are the factors that need to be considered:

Which blockchain has the most NFT buyers and sellers?

Is there a secondary market or alternative market on the Internet to sell and trade NFTs?

Available applications and services: What types of wallets, exchanges and other blockchain-based services can be used?

The cost of creating an NFT: As mentioned earlier, out-of-pocket costs for developing an NFT can be very expensive. However, the choice of platform will affect how and when these fees are collected, and some blockchain fees will be lower.

They have the potential to transcend the field of art, so their use cases will continue to grow and become more and more critical.
