**Introduction:**

[Twinci](https://Twinci.io) is the first NFTs social marketplace, where you can Create, Sell and Collect digital works that are kept safe by blockchain. We are on Binance Smart Chain with Interoperability, Cheap Transactions and fast Transaction Speed. Twinci aims to connect content creators with artworks hunters and create an ecosystem for buying and selling digital products in which KOLs have permanent royalties and collectors can verify the origin of the products, and trade them to generate income.
For Twinci team, NFTs is the way we help fans get to buy authentic items from their idols and for artists to get permanent royalties for their works. 

**Which field do you think has the most potential for NFT to be implemented? **

As stated, NFTs is the way we help fans get to buy authentic items from their idols and for artists to get permanent royalties for their works. 
A social marketplace like Twinci is the place to bring creators and art lovers together, enable the authenticity, and the benefit the artists deserve: Lifetime royalties.

**What do you think is the biggest challenge so far in the NFT application? **

The biggest challenge is that not a lot of artists can make use of this technology. If they do, the benefit is for everyone.

**What is the most exciting part of your project so far and in the future?**

We do have a lot going on, and we expect having more in the next phase to come.
