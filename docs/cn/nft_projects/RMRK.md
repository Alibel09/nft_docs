Could you introduce your project?
RMRK is the world's most advanced NFT system. It enables much more than current NFT systems on EVM chains do. With RMRK, we have:

- NFTs owning NFTs
- NFTs governed as DAOs via shareholder tokens (issue commands to NFTs democratically)
- NFTs having multiple priority-ordered client-dependent resources (a book with a cover and an audio version)
- NFTs being emoted to (on-chain emotes), allowing early price discovery without listing, selling, bidding.
- NFTs with conditional rendering (on-NFT logic allowing different visuals and resources to trigger depending on on-chain and off-chain conditions).

What is your belief in NFT? Which field do you think has the most potential for NFT to be implemented? 
Gaming has the highest potential, and virtual / augmented reality. Virtual real estate management, eye-layer replacement of advertisements, selling virtual space around you as NFTs, all of this is extremely powerful.

What do you think is the biggest challenge so far in the NFT application? 
User experience - it is very difficult for users to get started with wallets etc. Once we improve the user-flow properly, we will have mainstream adoption.

What is the most exciting part of your project so fa and in the future?
Partnerships with most of the heavy-hitter chains in the Kusama ecosystem. We partnered up with Karura, Khala, Unique, Zeitgeist, Litentry, Bit.country, Shiden, and many more...
