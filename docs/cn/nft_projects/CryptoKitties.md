CryptoKitties is a blockchain virtual game launched by Vancouver Axiom Zen, which allows players to adopt, feed, and trade virtual cats. The rise of CryptoKitties coincided with the bull market in 2017\. Driven by the enthusiasm of CryptoKitties enthusiasts, the price of some virtual cats madly rose to 100,000 U.S. dollars, and the public noticed the potential and power of non-homogeneous tokens.Subsequently, Axiom Zen spun off Dapper Labs.
